                                            <p>A Story Map I created in GIS exploring food desserts in the US. This assignment shows how I used map data to tell the story of lack of access to healthy food in certain neighborhoods. This. Is done by using provided data to highlight specific areas on a map. Not certain if I solved any real-world problems yet, which this is, but this could be used to bring awareness to our politicians that can enact certain policies to help reduce the lack of access to healthier dietary options in less fortunate areas. The people who are affected by this situation would benefit the most from my assignment.</p>

                                            <p>A paper I wrote in English Comp about the effects of new language learners being able to learn a new language based on their literacy in their native language. I used research and information gathering, and this was demonstrated by conducting extensive reviews of different academic literature related to second language literacy acquisition. I used online databases, library resources, and scholarly articles to gather relevant information. In the process of this assignment, I addressed the real-world problem of understanding the existing knowledge and theories regarding second language literacy acquisition. This is essential for educators and policymakers looking to improve language education programs for second language learners. Educators, researchers, and policymakers interested in second language literacy acquisition and language education would be interested in seeing that I completed this assignment.</p>

                                            <p>For my Foundation of IS class I did a case study using webtools to plan a trip. The competency/skills I used was research and analysis. I demonstrated this competency by conducting research on various technology tools like Google Flights, Google Maps, and Google Sheets to efficiently plan a two-week trip. I analyzed the features of these tools and their applications in travel planning. For this assignment, I addressed the real-world problem of time efficiency in travel planning. Travelers often seek ways to plan their trips quickly and effectively, and I explored how technology tools can help solve this problem. My target audience would be travelers, especially those planning trips on their own, would be interested in seeing that I completed this assignment. Additionally, travel enthusiasts, technology users, and individuals interested in travel industry innovations may also find it relevant.</p>

                                            <p>In this project, I acquired COVID-19 vaccination data from both a web API and a CSV dataset, demonstrating the ability to gather data from diverse sources. I then performed data transformations, aggregation, and statistical analysis to gain insights into vaccination trends. Additionally, I visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to make it more accessible. Using data acquisition and processing I was able to demonstrate this by acquiring data from both a web API and a CSV file, using libraries like Pandas to create DataFrames and manipulate the data. I also performed data transformations, such as converting date columns to datetime format. In this project, I addressed the real-world problem of analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 vaccination data to understand vaccination trends across different demographic categories and states. My target audience would be public health professionals, policymakers, and data analysts interested in COVID-19 vaccination trends and their association with demographic factors would be interested in this project.</p>
